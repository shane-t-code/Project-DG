This is a work in progress.

In this fast-paced action game the user controls a duck character, and has to collect it's golden eggs that were stolen by the geese organization. Armed with feather projectiles, the duck has to navigate through levels, collect the stolen golden eggs, and dodge AI-controlled enemy geese, all under a time limit.
